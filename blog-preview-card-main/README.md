## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

Tried to use Semantic HTML5 elements again. I am getting good probably. This time mobile first workflow was problematic (I think). The provided design images had different `card` width on mobile and desktop. Also all the elements had different properties too. I only noticed that after finalizing everything (in my mind). Then added some media query ðŸ˜„

### Continued development

I will continue using Semantic HTML5 elements. Also I will imporve on naming skills with BEM.

### Useful resources

- [MDN css organizing guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing) - I tried to follow this to organize css.
- [BEM naming guide](https://getbem.com/naming/) - Used this to make the class naming more consistant.
