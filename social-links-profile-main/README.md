## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

Learned quite a bit more about semantic elements. Tried to use them properly. Don't know if it's good or not. Also tried to give style names some prefix like `c-` for componant and `l-` for layout elements.

### Continued development

I will keep learning semantic elements and BEM.
